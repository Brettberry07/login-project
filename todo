üßê What‚Äôs Going Well

    Secure Passwords & SQL

        You hash passwords with bcrypt and use ? placeholders to prevent injection.

    Stateless Auth with Cookies

        You sign JWTs server-side, set them in HttpOnly, SameSite cookies, and clear on logout.

    Input Validation & Rate-Limiting

        You validate email/password at both signup and login, and throttle requests globally.

    Structured Logging

        Morgan for HTTP requests + Winston for application-level logs (with separate error.log).

üîß Minor Improvements & Clean-up

    Centralize Error Handling

        Instead of sprinkling res.status(‚Ä¶).send(‚Ä¶) everywhere, consider an Express ‚Äúerror middleware‚Äù so you can throw new ApiError(‚Ä¶) in routes and have one place to format/log responses.

    Extract Secrets & Config

        You already use .env, but you might group configs into a config.js module (module.exports = { port, dbPath, jwtSecret }) for cleaner imports.

    Move Routes Into Their Own Module

        For larger apps, split off routes/auth.js, routes/users.js with controllers, so main.js just does app.use('/login', authRouter), etc.

    Cookie Security in Production

        In production, ensure secure: true (HTTPS) and consider sameSite: 'lax' if you ever need third-party embeds.

    Periodic Blacklist Cleanup

        Add a small cron (e.g. setInterval) that deletes expired entries from blacklisted_tokens so the table doesn‚Äôt grow unbounded.

üöÄ What to Tackle Next

    Refresh Tokens

        Issue short-lived access tokens (1 h) and longer-lived refresh tokens (7 d) in a separate cookie. On access-token expiry, use the refresh token to mint a new access token.

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

        Add a role column (e.g. user, admin) and guard certain routes (e.g. delete users) with middleware that checks req.user.role.

    Email Verification & Password Reset

        Send a one-time code or link via email for new accounts or resets, so you learn about sending emails, tokenizing one-timers, and expiring them.

    API Documentation & Testing

        Add Swagger (OpenAPI) docs for your endpoints, and write automated tests (Jest + Supertest) to verify authentication flows.

    Move to a ‚ÄúReal‚Äù DB for Production

        Try PostgreSQL or MySQL. You‚Äôll learn migrations (e.g. with Knex or Sequelize), connection pooling, and finer‚Äêgrained permissions.

    Security Hardeners

        Add Helmet for secure HTTP headers, set up Content Security Policy (CSP), and consider CSRF tokens even with SameSite cookies.

    CI/CD & Containerization

        Dockerize your app, add a GitHub Actions pipeline to run tests on each PR, and deploy to a free tier (Heroku, Fly.io, Render).

üéØ TL;DR

Your ‚Äúsimple‚Äù project already touches the core pillars of modern backend security:

    Auth (JWT, cookies, blacklisting)

    Input Safety (validation, parameterization)

    Resilience (rate limiting)

    Observability (logging)

If you want to keep iterating, I‚Äôd next add refresh tokens and role-based access, then layer in email workflows, testing, and‚Äîwhen you outgrow SQLite‚Äîa migration to a production‚Äêgrade database. That‚Äôll round out the full spectrum of real-world backend development!
