üöÄ What to Tackle Next

    Refresh Tokens

        Issue short-lived access tokens (1 h) and longer-lived refresh tokens (7 d) in a separate cookie. On access-token expiry, use the refresh token to mint a new access token.

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

        Add a role column (e.g. user, admin) and guard certain routes (e.g. delete users) with middleware that checks req.user.role.

    Email Verification & Password Reset

        Send a one-time code or link via email for new accounts or resets, so you learn about sending emails, tokenizing one-timers, and expiring them.

    API Documentation & Testing

        Add Swagger (OpenAPI) docs for your endpoints, and write automated tests (Jest + Supertest) to verify authentication flows.

    Move to a ‚ÄúReal‚Äù DB for Production

        Try PostgreSQL or MySQL. You‚Äôll learn migrations (e.g. with Knex or Sequelize), connection pooling, and finer‚Äêgrained permissions.

    Security Hardeners

        Add Helmet for secure HTTP headers, set up Content Security Policy (CSP), and consider CSRF tokens even with SameSite cookies.

    CI/CD & Containerization

        Dockerize your app, add a GitHub Actions pipeline to run tests on each PR, and deploy to a free tier (Heroku, Fly.io, Render).
